# Two Pass Assembler

## Overview

The Two Pass Assembler is a web-based tool built with Django that simulates the first and second passes of an assembler. It allows users to upload input files and an operation table (OPTAB) to generate intermediate and object code based on assembly language instructions. The application features a user-friendly interface for running passes and viewing results, including symbol tables and program lengths.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload input files containing assembly instructions and a corresponding OPTAB file.
- **Pass 1 Logic**: Processes the input file to generate intermediate file content and a symbol table.
- **Pass 2 Logic**: Uses the intermediate content and symbol table to produce the final object code.
- **Clear Functionality**: Allows users to clear all session data and reset the page.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user feedback if Pass 1 is not completed before running Pass 2.

## Installation

To set up the Two Pass Assembler, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django

### Steps

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: 
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: 
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations**: 
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: 
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: 
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the Two Pass Assembler.

## Usage

1. **Upload Files**: 
   - Use the "Input File" field to upload your assembly language file.
   - Use the "OPTAB File" field to upload the operation table.

2. **Run Pass 1**: 
   - Click the "Run Pass 1" button to process the uploaded files. 
   - The results, including the intermediate file content and symbol table, will be displayed on the page.

3. **Run Pass 2**: 
   - If Pass 1 is successful, click the "Run Pass 2" button to generate the object code.

4. **Clear Data**: 
   - Click the "Clear" button to reset the application, clearing all session data.

5. **Error Handling**: 
   - If you attempt to run Pass 2 without completing Pass 1, an error message will prompt you to run Pass 1 first.

## Code Explanation

### Views

The main functionality of the application resides in the `single_page_view` function within the `views.py` file. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

- **Pass 1 Logic**: 
  - Reads the uploaded input and OPTAB files.
  - Processes the assembly instructions to generate intermediate content and a symbol table.
  - Stores results in the session.

- **Pass 2 Logic**: 
  - Retrieves intermediate content and symbol table from the session.
  - Generates object code based on the retrieved data.

- **Clear Functionality**: 
  - Clears all session data when the "Clear" button is clicked.

### HTML Template

The `single_page.html` template provides the user interface, allowing users to upload files and view results. The key elements include:

- **File Input Fields**: For uploading input and OPTAB files.
- **Buttons**: For running passes and clearing data.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays results only if Pass 1 or Pass 2 has been completed.

### Session Management

Session management is crucial for maintaining state across requests. The application uses Django's built-in session framework to store intermediate content, symbol tables, program lengths, and object code.
